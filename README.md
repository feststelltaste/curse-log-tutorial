# Curse Log Tutorial
This is a mini tutorial for teaching Python, pandas and matplotlib.

## Scenario

In the future, every human has a microchip implant that tracks uttered curses.

From a data leakage, we have the curse log (`dataset/curse_log.gz`) and a list of user profiles (`dataset/profiles.csv.gz`).

**Let's analyzed it!!**
